# Hello there! I'm Songle Jin

I'm a software engineer deeply into Typescript, React, and a bunch more:
Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Postgres, Kubernetes, Golang, Flutter and more.
I've built robust applications, played with databases, orchestrated scalable systems,
and dabbled in various languages and frameworks.
